# ✅ Logging System Setup Complete

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Winston Logging Integration
- ✅ Installed `winston` and `nest-winston` packages
- ✅ Created comprehensive logging configuration with environment-based settings
- ✅ Implemented structured JSON logging for production
- ✅ Added colorized console logging for development

### 2. Custom Logger Service
- ✅ Built `CustomLoggerService` with specialized logging methods
- ✅ Added context-aware logging for each service
- ✅ Implemented structured logging with metadata support
- ✅ Created specialized methods for:
  - HTTP request logging
  - API call performance tracking
  - Image generation/variation/editing logging
  - Performance metrics logging
  - Security event logging

### 3. HTTP Request Interceptor
- ✅ Automatic logging of all HTTP requests
- ✅ Response time tracking
- ✅ Request/response correlation
- ✅ Sensitive header sanitization
- ✅ Performance monitoring for slow requests

### 4. Module Integration
- ✅ Updated all service modules with comprehensive logging:
  - **ImageGenerationService**: Tracks generation requests, API calls, performance
  - **ImageVariationService**: Logs variation requests and performance metrics
  - **ImageEditingService**: Monitors editing operations with detailed metrics
- ✅ Added logging context to each service
- ✅ Implemented error tracking with stack traces

### 5. Environment Configuration
- ✅ Added logging environment variables:
  - `LOG_LEVEL`: Controls verbosity (error, warn, info, debug, verbose)
  - `APP_NAME`: Service identification in logs
  - `NODE_ENV`: Environment-specific logging behavior
- ✅ **REMOVED**: All Stability AI references (STABILITY_API_KEY)
- ✅ Clean environment configuration with only necessary variables

### 6. File Structure Created
```

```

### 7. Documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive `LOGGING.md` documentation
- ✅ Updated README with logging information
- ✅ Removed all Stability AI references from documentation

## Key Features

### Development Logging
```
14:30:25.123 INFO [ImageGenerationService] Starting image generation {"prompt":"A beautiful sunset..."}
```

### Production Logging
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15 14:30:25.123",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "viewcreator-api",
  "context": "ImageGenerationService",
  "message": "Starting image generation",
  "meta": {
    "prompt": "A beautiful sunset...",
    "aspectRatio": "16:9",
    "style": "photorealistic"
  }
}
```

### Automatic Performance Tracking
- Image generation operations >10s flagged as slow
- Image editing operations >5s flagged as slow
- API call duration tracking
- HTTP request performance monitoring

### Security Event Logging
- Invalid image upload attempts
- Failed authentication (when implemented)
- Suspicious activity patterns

## Environment Variables

Current `.env.example`:
```env
# API Configuration
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
APP_NAME=viewcreator-api

# Logging Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Vertex AI
VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your_gcp_project_id
VERTEX_LOCATION=us-central1

# CORS Configuration
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
```

## What to Do Next

1. **Copy environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Set your Vertex variables**:
   ```env
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your_actual_gcp_project_id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=us-central1
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

4. **Monitor logs**:
   - Development: Colorized console output
   - Production: JSON logs in `logs/` directory

## Build Status
✅ **All TypeScript compilation errors resolved**
✅ **Build successful**
✅ **No Stability AI references remaining**

The logging system is now fully integrated and ready for production use!
